# MCP Chatbot Host

A console chatbot that acts as an **MCP host**: it coordinates several Model
Context Protocol clients, exposes their tools to a Claude model, and runs the
tool-use loop.

The Model Context Protocol is implemented **directly over JSON-RPC 2.0**, with
no MCP SDK. Every frame exchanged with a server is built, parsed and logged by
this codebase.

Course project for CC3067 Redes — Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.

## Status

Under development. See `docs/` for the assignment brief and the use case.

## Requirements

- Go 1.24 or newer
- Node.js (only to run the official MCP servers through `npx`)

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/host` | Entry point of the chatbot |
| `internal/jsonrpc` | JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope, client and request/response correlation |
| `internal/transport` | Frame transports: stdio for local servers, HTTP for remote ones |
| `internal/mcp` | MCP message types and session lifecycle |
| `internal/mcplog` | Human-readable log of every JSON-RPC frame |
| `config` | Declarative list of MCP servers to launch |
